# Problem 1

## a)
Proof:

> let $a = 0$ and arbitrary $b \in \mathbb{N}$
>
> $0 \in \mathbb{N}$, so $a \in \mathbb{N}$
>
> By definition of natural numbers, $0$ is the smallest natural number. Thus $a = 0$ is the smallest natural number. Thus the statement $a \leq b$ holds true, since arbitrary $b$ can only be $\geq 0$
>
> Thus $a \leq b$ when $a = 0$, satisfying the condition $\blacksquare$

## b)
$x^2 - 2x - 8 = 0, (x-4)(x+2) = 0, x = 4, -2$
